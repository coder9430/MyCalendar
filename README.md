Calendar App
Description:
This is a calendar application that allows users to view a calendar, manage events, and store them persistently. Users can add, edit, and delete events for any day, and events are saved between page refreshes using localStorage. The app features a modern UI with clear visual indicators for the current day, selected day, and events. It also handles month transitions and prevents overlapping events.
